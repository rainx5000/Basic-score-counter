# Basic-score-counter

1/11/21 - This is another project from Colt steeles course

He showed the studends the criteria for this project. I tackled the project, I was able to create what he wanted. I did not like the way I coded it, it looked messy, got some 
advice from some people, and made it alittle bit cleaner, I am currently working on bettering my structure. I am still pretty bad at it, but time and practice and I will get better.
Thank you, and have a great day!
